This is a GUI application for managing tasks with features to display, organize, and filter tasks based on their priority. Users can:

**Display all tasks:** Tasks are listed with details such as description, duration, and priority. Tasks with the highest priority are bolded for better visibility.

**Filter tasks by priority:** Users can input a priority level to view all tasks with that specific priority. The application calculates and displays the total duration of these tasks.

**Organize tasks:** Tasks are sorted by priority and, within the same priority level, by their duration for a clear and structured view.

This tool provides an efficient way to manage and prioritize tasks, especially in scenarios involving multiple tasks with varying importance levels.
